# AI Jokes APP

This project is a joke generator that allows you to customize various aspects of the jokes it creates. You can select specific topics, types of jokes, and tones. Additionally, you can fine-tune the joke generation using a parameter called "temperature." The tool also includes a feature that lets the AI evaluate the jokes for humor, appropriateness, and potential offensiveness.
